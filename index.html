Mining is also how new Bitcoin is entered into circulation. “Bitcoin mining is what makes the Bitcoin network secure,” says Stefan Ristić, owner of the educational website BitcoinMiningSoftware.com <br>High-powered computers compete to be the first to validate a series of transactions called a block, and add the block to the blockchain. <br>Miners are paid transaction fees and 6.25 BTC per block for their efforts (if they solve the block correctly). That’s around $147,000 at today’s prices.
      “The mining, or transaction processing, is accomplished by incredibly expensive and powerful computers whose sole function is to run algorithms to solve the mathematical problem that allows their owner to win a Bitcoin block—and the revenue that comes with it,” says Richard Baker, CEO of miner and blockchain services provider TAAL Distributed Information Technologies.</p>
